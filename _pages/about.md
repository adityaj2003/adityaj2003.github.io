Hello! Welcome to my personal website. This is a place to share my personality and experiences a little more than what is seen on a 1 page resume.

I am Aditya Jadhav, junior at the University of Arizona currently majoring in CS with minors in Information Science and SDS (Statistics and Data Science). I have experience with <strong>Java</strong> and Python. I have experience working with <strong>PHP, JS, MariaDB</strong> as well. Currently interested and working on <strong>ML/AI</strong> projects with <strong>Python, TensorFlow and Keras</strong>. My Projects can be accessed through the Projects tab at the top. 

I currently work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [ToMCAT project](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/). I made a Flask webapp using Python for the project previously and currently working on a data visualisation dashboard using wxWdigets and C++. 

In my spare time, I love solving algorithmic problems and tinkering and tearing up electronics. I also love playing chess, badminton and spending time with friends and family.
