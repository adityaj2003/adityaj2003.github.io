Hello! Welcome to my personal website. This is a place to share my personality and experiences a little more than what is seen on a 1 page resume.

I am Aditya Jadhav, junior at the University of Arizona currently majoring in CS with a minor in SDS (Statistics and Data Science). I have experience with <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. I have experience working with Web development mainly MERN Stack. Have experience with AWS and Database Systems (MongoDB and PostGreSQL). Currently interested and working on <strong>ML/AI</strong> projects with <strong>Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy</strong>. My Projects can be accessed through the Projects tab at the top. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer Intern at Astrocomm Technologies mainly in building GUIs using wxPython and writing Arduino C code to handle ADC data. My future work involves elasticsearch analyzing data using ML techniques. Apart from that work under Dr. Chicheng Zhang at the UArizona CS Department on active learning using early stopping gradient descent under
Tsybakov Noise. Currently writing the theoretical algorithm into code for reducing label complexity in Python. I previously worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [ToMCAT project](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/). I made a Flask webapp using Python for the project previously and data visualisation dashboard using wxWdigets and C++ for displaying sensor data captured throughtout the experiment. 

In my spare time, I love solving algorithmic problems and tinkering and tearing up electronics. I also love playing chess, badminton and recently pickleball.
