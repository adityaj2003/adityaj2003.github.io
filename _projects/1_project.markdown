Built a working replica of the popular wordle game implementing Object Oriented
Programming. The GUI works exactly like the wordle game with animations, on
screen buttons and keyboard input. <br/><br/>
The program is made using Java and JavaFX keeping OOP in mind. This was built as a class project which I implemented further and implemented on-screen buttons along with keyboard input and further improved the aesthetics with getting the original colors of wordle by inspect-element. Also has animations which are implemented by JavaFX


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/Wordle_SS.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    The image represents the state of the game after the word has been guessed. The different colors for the letters guessed can be seen along with showing the letters already guessed underneath.
</div>
