Built a working ToDoList using Java and JavaFX. Users can add different tasks,
customize lists, add deadlines and sort tasks by deadline or priority. <br/><br/>
The program takes input about the a new list or task with a pop-up screen. The user inputs name, deadline and other things (or choose to ignore them) and the new task shows up on the GUI. JavaFX is now outdated and therefore doesn't allow a very aesthetic looking GUI but it can be replicated using any other library as well. <br/><br/>
The tasks can be sorted by either deadline, priority or time created. Users can also tick off tasks completed, edit tasks or remove tasks. The tasks are color coded according to their priority for visual ease as well.
